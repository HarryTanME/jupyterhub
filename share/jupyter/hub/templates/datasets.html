 <dd>High-quality financial data is expensive to acquire and is therefore rarely shared for free. Here I provide the full historical daily price and volume data for all U.S.-based stocks and ETFs trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ, and NYSE MKT. It's one of the best datasets of its kind you can obtain.
    <p/>The data (last updated 11/10/2017) is presented in CSV format as follows: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, OpenInt. Note that prices have been adjusted for dividends and splits.

 <p>It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.</p>

 <p>The CIFAR-10 dataset The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class.</p>

Reviews include product and user information, ratings, and a plaintext review. Note: this dataset contains potential duplicates, due to products whose reviews Amazon merges. A file has been added below (possible_dupes.txt.gz) to help identify products that are potentially duplicates of each other.&quot;</dd>

 <dd>Overview
 <p>It contains 11 action categories: basketball shooting, biking/cycling, diving, golf swinging, horse back riding, soccer juggling, swinging, tennis swinging, trampoline jumping, volleyball spiking, and walking with a dog. This data set is very challenging due to large variations in camera motion, object appearance and pose, object scale, viewpoint, cluttered background, illumination conditions, etc. For each category, the videos are grouped into 25 groups with more than 4 action clips in it. The video clips in the same group share some common features, such as the same actor, similar background, similar viewpoint, and so on. The videos are ms mpeg4 format. You need to install the right Codec (e.g. K-lite Codec Pack contains a cellection of Codecs) to access them. If you happen to use this data set, you can refer the following paper: J. Liu, J. Luo and M. Shah, Recognizing realistic actions from videos &#39;in the wild&#39;, CVPR 2009, Miami, FL. (For action biking and walking class, we select all the videos; for the rest of action classes, we only select the videos numbered from 01 to 04 from each group).</p>

 <dd>This directory contains the alphanumeric database (aka &#39;census&#39; aka &#39;an4&#39;) recorded at Carnegie Mellon University circa 1991. This database is described in details in &#39;Acoustical and environmental robustness in automatic speech recognition&#39;, by Alex Acero, published by Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1993.
 <p>Subjects were asked to spell out personal information, such as name, address, telephone number, birthdates, etc. They were instructed to not use their actual numbers. In addition to these, subjects also spoke randomly generated sequences of words containing control words. The database used internally at CMU has 1018 training and 140 test utterances, whereas the database provided here has 948 training and 130 test utterances. The sentences containing social security numbers were removed, just in case any of the subjects did not follow the advice to use a fake number. All data are sampled at 16 kHz, 16-bit linear sampling. All recordings were made with a close talking microphone.</p>

 <p>Deeply Moving: Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis This website provides a live demo for predicting the sentiment of movie reviews. Most sentiment prediction systems work just by looking at words in isolation, giving positive points for positive words and negative points for negative words and then summing up these points. That way, the order of words is ignored and important information is lost. In constrast, our new deep learning model actually builds up a representation of whole sentences based on the sentence structure. It computes the sentiment based on how words compose the meaning of longer phrases. This way, the model is not as easily fooled as previous models.&nbsp;</p>

 <dd>People can immediately and precisely identify that an image contains 1, 2, 3 or 4 items by a simple glance. The phenomenon, known as Subitizing, inspires us to pursue the task of Salient Object Subitizing, i.e. predicting the existence and the number of salient objects in a scene using holistic cues. We have collected two benchmark image datasets for salient object subitizing, and include a baseline algorithm as described in: Jianming Zhang, Shugao Ma, Mehrnoosh Sameki, Stan Sclaroff, Margrit Betke, Zhe Lin, Xiaohui Shen, Brian Price and Radomir Mech, &ldquo;Salient Object Subitizing&rdquo;.

 <dd>The goal of this work is to provide an empirical basis for research on image segmentation and boundary detection. To this end, we have collected 12,000 hand-labeled segmentations of 1,000 Corel dataset images from 30 human subjects. Half of the segmentations were obtained from presenting the subject with a color image; the other half from presenting a grayscale image. The public benchmark based on this data consists of all of the grayscale and color segmentations for 300 images. The images are divided into a training set of 200 images, and a test set of 100 images.</dd>
